The software is now ready to use.

## Usage

The unitProps class is meant as a superclass that provides functionality for unit conversion. Declare unitProps as a superclass
```
classdef myCLass < unitProps
```
. The code can also be used stand-alone but has limited use here:
```
up = unitProps();
```
check the default colormap
```
pl.colormap
```
and get 10 RGB values of the current colormap
```
cmap = pl.getColormap(10);
```
.

## Documentation

Type
```
doc plotProps
```
for the documentation or
```
help plotProps.getColormap
```
for the documentation of a specific function, which is the 'getColormap' function in this example.

If the plotProps class is a superclass of myClass, then use the 'getColormap' as follows
```
cmap = myClass.getColormap(10)
```
this is will result in the 10 RGB pairs of the colormap defined in 
```
myClass.colormap
```
.
